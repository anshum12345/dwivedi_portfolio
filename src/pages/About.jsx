                        Iâ€™m a creative full-stack engineer focused on building expressive products with a strong
                        foundation in performance, accessibility, and motion. I blend design thinking with code to
                        craft delightful, functional experiences.

                    <p>
                        My toolbox includes React, GSAP, Three.js, and Tailwind. I enjoy translating complex ideas
                        into intuitive, animated interfaces and leading design-system driven builds.
